            <h1>Biotechnology – A Solution to Hunger</h1>
            <div class="con1_top_text">

            <div class="con1_top_text">
                World hunger and food insecurity is a recurring problem in most parts of the developing world. Among the
                many potential biotechnologies that are available, and the different ways in which they can be applied, genetic modification (GM) of crops demands particular attention. Genetically modified crops possessing
                genes from different species, could possibly relieve global food shortages. Although initial excitement surrounded the use of GM crops -- that they will provide bigger and better harvests for farmers -- there are still
                questions about the benefits of such crops. In addition, the general public may not welcome the creation of
                "super plants" as a viable option in solving global hunger
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The environmental impact of GM crops is important with regard to creating food security in developing
                countries. Genetically modified crops can potentially fail to germinate; kill organisms other than pests that
                are beneficial to plants and reduce soil fertility; and potentially transfer insecticidal properties or virus resistance to wild relatives of the crop species.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                A segment of the scientific community often proposes that export earnings from higher agricultural yields
                can contribute to reducing food insecurity and hunger in developing countries. However, there are many
                issues and challenges that beg the practicality of this proposal. A few crop varieties, specially created
                through biotechnology, can improve yields, but biotechnology alone cannot solve the problem of hunger in
                the developing world
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Nevertheless, the potential advantages that biotechnology can confer across a wide range of agricultural
                applications are in areas such as livestock management, storage of agricultural products and sustaining
                current crop yields, while reducing the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. The real challenge is
                whether we are smart enough to harness the benefits of biotechnological solutions. But what are these
                solutions?
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Biotechnology offers a very promising alternative to synthetic foods and an improvement on conventional
                plant-breeding technologies. Combined with other advanced agricultural technologies, it offers an exciting
                and environmentally responsible way to meet consumer demand for sustainable agriculture. When the benefits of GM crops reach small and marginal farmers, more Green Revolutions may become a reality.

                Combating Hunger and Malnutrition
                Malnutrition is the related term in medicine for hunger. The most recent estimate of the Food and Agriculture Organization says that 854 million people worldwide are undernourished. This is 12.6 per cent of 6.6
                billion people in the world. Many of the 854 million that are undernourished, children being the most visible
                victims, live in developing countries. Undernutrition magnifies the impact of every disease, including measles and malaria
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Intellectual Property and Food Security
                There are concerns about a technological landscape controlled almost exclusively by the private sector and
                defined by patent protection. Patents allow large, private firms substantial control over plant genes, which
                has worrisome implications. If farmers have to purchase seeds during every sowing season, it affects their
                income and food security. Although biotech companies such as Monsanto and AstraZeneca have announced that they would not commercialize the so-called "Terminator" or seed-sterilization technology,
                which is genetically designed to "switch off" a plant's ability to germinate a second time, the biotech industry collectively owns at least three dozen patents that control either seed germination or essential plant germination processes. This privatization of a plant's genetic resources puts not only agricultural research in
                developing nations at a disadvantage, but might ultimately threaten the livelihoods of a majority of small
                farmers in Africa, Latin America, and Asia who largely depend on seed saved from one crop to sow in the
                next.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In developing countries, there may be a potential negative impact from Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
                over biotechnological products or the processes used in producing them. IPRs have been held not only by
                private companies, but also by some public organizations making it impossible to use any aspect of biotechnology for improving major crop species without infringing a patent somewhere in the process. Because of IPRs, it has not always been possible to separate the biotechnology prospects from the business
                interests involved. A major consequence of IPR in agricultural biotechnology is that many developing countries which have not yet invested in biotechnology may never be able to catch up in the future.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The world's food supply is abundant, not scarce. The world's production of grain and other foods is sufficient to provide at least 4.3 pounds of food per person, per day. The real reason for hunger in the world is
                poverty, which often strikes women--the nutritional gatekeepers in many families--the hardest. Economists
                argue that resolving hunger requires political solutions and not just agro-technical solutions. According to
                them, instead of looking at biotechnology as a yet unproven and non-existent breakthrough, decision
                makers should look at the full body of research that shows that solutions to eliminate hunger are not technological in nature, but rooted in basic socio-economic realities. This is not to say that technology, including
                biotechnology, does not play a role in reducing, say, malnutrition, but there is no technology that can override the immediate political and social forces that keep people poor and hungry. The global biotechnology
                industry has funnelled a vast majority of its investment into a limited range of products that have large, secured markets in the First World -- products which are of little relevance to the needs of the world's hungry.
                Biotechnology has applications that can significantly solve the problem of world hunger. Green is the colour
                of agricultural biotechnology, of fertility, self-respect and well-being. In my opinion, policymakers should
                pragmatically consider modern biotech discoveries and assets as an important tool for solving the problem
                of global hunger.
