                To the Editor — Gene editing and other biotechnologies have the potential to address urgent dilemmas in
                the environment, human health and food security. However, these technologies also raise potential for societal concerns, environmental and health risks, and conflicts with cultural and spiritual values. Previous experience with the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the food system has in some
                instances resulted in public mistrust, underscoring the need for greater transparency, better governance
                and improved oversight of the deployment of these technologies.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                As representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), we recognize the potential societal benefits
                of gene-editing technologies, while acknowledging their potential risks. However, we contend that the
                United States has inadequate regulatory oversight to address concerns presented by biotechnology7,8,9.
                Thus far, efforts to articulate principles that might govern the safe development and release of biotech products have largely taken place in the academic domain, have omitted key stakeholder endorsements and
                have lacked a strategy for influencing governance and consumer acceptance. In contrast, NGOs focused
                on consumer and environmental advocacy, with millions of members, actively engage with government regulators and industry stakeholders. Like other authors6,7, we are concerned that gene-edited products could
                follow the same path as GMOs, which suffer from limited products, exclusive development, and substantial
                consumer avoidance and skepticism. These factors lead to the potential societal benefits of such products
                remaining unrealized. Our principles could apply to products produced with almost any technology, but we
                have focused on genetic editing because of the following: this methodology has the potential for safe and
                beneficial applications; new products are being developed rapidly; regulation and introduction of new products into commerce is controversial (unlike introduction of conventional crops produced using mutagenesis); and the lack of appropriate governance could lead to unintended environmental consequences or severely limit its use. Therefore, here we offer governance principles as a starting point and roadmap for collaboration among many sectors (scientists, product developers, policymakers, regulators, companies, civil
                society, and consumers) that could jointly develop a pathway to the responsible innovation, governance,
                and deployment of gene-editing technology.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Advancing this dialog is timely because several developers are poised to introduce gene-edited products
                into commerce5. In 2020, under an Executive Order to “streamline processes and remove overly burdensome regulations,” the US Department of Agriculture substantially deregulated gene-edited plants and proposed a similarly minimal oversight system for gene-edited animals. Without sufficient governance,
                gene-edited products released into the environment may pose risks to biodiversity, and even the most
                benign innovations could lack public trust6,10. In addition to the voluntary solutions proposed by some authors (for example, ref. 9), the principles we endorse here include policies, such as the introduction of a national registry of gene-editing applications in use in the United States, that are critical to managing risk and
                fostering public trust.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Biden administration in the United States will likely take a fresh look at biotech oversight and decide
                whether to continue or reverse deregulation. They will look to our organizations for constructive approaches
                and to bring the perspectives and support of our many members. Therefore, our principles (Fig. 1 and Table
                1) for gene-editing governance in the public and private sectors focus on the US context, recognizing that
                governance in the United States can influence outcomes elsewhere. Gene-editing techniques, while often
                allowing more rapid and precise genetic alterations than earlier technologies11, are not independent of the
                broader social, ecological and economic histories, contexts and debates related to earlier genetic engineering technologies, including perceived prior harms and failures of biotechnologies to live up to promises to
                deliver broad societal benefit.

            <div class="con1_top_text">
                We have focused on gene-editing applications in agriculture and the environment in developing these principles, both because CRISPR–Cas and other advances are supporting rapid development of new products
                and because we see the current governance and regulatory framework as inadequate for addressing applications of these technologies9,12. Since these products are being, and will continue to be, developed and
                applied in agriculture and the environment, we must consider how this activity occurs and under whose
                management, oversight and stewardship. In the text below, we outline six principles for responsible governance
            </div>
            <h1>Principle 1: risk avoidance and delivery of tangible societal benefits</h1>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Gene editing should be safely and ethically developed and transparently deployed. Safeguards should be
                in place that ensure gene editing is carefully developed and then applied and stewarded to manage for potential risks to agriculture, food systems, human health, non-human species and the environment. Regulatory bodies need to assess the potential risks of a particular use or application of gene editing using a science-based risk assessment. For example, risks may be associated with unintended non-target changes in
                the genome or environmental impacts of toxicity, gene flow and invasion2,12. Where the potential risks associated with a product are substantial and cannot be adequately managed, that product should not be approved for use and released into the environment.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                At the same time, gene editing should be inclusively developed. Product developers should consider, with
                the input of societal stakeholders7,8,9,13, how gene editing could be applied to support a broad range of
                benefits. These might include ecological, social and climate resilience; biological diversity; natural resources; human and animal health and welfare; economic and rural development; equitable societal outcomes;
                context-specific cultural values; energy security; and food sovereignty. Risks and benefits should be
                weighed against the counterfactuals of continuing with business as usual against the backdrop of a changing climate and growing human population
            </div>
            <h1>Principle 2: robust, inclusive societal engagement</h1>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Technology developers should take proactive, inclusive steps to identify, engage, and incorporate input of
                diverse communities, stakeholders, and publics at an early stage in the research and development cycle of
                individual products2,7,8,9,13. Transparent, respectful dialog should incorporate diverse viewpoints and the
                preferences of different regions and cultures, including those that do not support the proposed applications.
                Developers should strive to create solutions acceptable and responsive to those engaged.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The regulatory process should engage proactively, transparently and meaningfully with stakeholders to
                help assess potential risks and benefits. Engagement should extend beyond traditional written comment
                processes and strive to maintain public and consumer trust in gene editing and its governance7,8,9,13.
