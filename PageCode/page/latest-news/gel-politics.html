                With a rapidly growing fan base, gene-editing tools enable experiments from basic biomedical research to
                crop science. Researchers use these tools to edit genomes at sites of their choosing. “The tools are now
                really good, and the applications are expanding,” says Andrew Scharenberg, chief scientific officer of Cellectis therapeutics, which focuses on biomedical applications of this technology

                Gene-editing tools are meeting the real world in an ongoing clinical trial sponsored by Sangamo BioSciences, whose results serve as a bellwether for the emerging industry. “It shows you the power of the tool and
                how far-reaching it is,” says Nathan Wood, vice president of synthetic biology at Life Technologies. With its
                drug candidate, Sangamo harnesses its intellectual property portfolio relating to a type of gene editor called
                a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), which can cut DNA at a predetermined point, leading to the ferrying in of a
                new gene or regulatory element or disrupting an existing gene.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In the trial, ZFNs are used to engineer a specific gene deletion into each patient's CD4+ T cells, a type of
                white blood cell. Where the gene edit is successful, the door through which human immunodeficiency virus
                (HIV) enters cells and assaults the immune system—the CCR5 co-receptor—is disrupted. According to results that Sangamo made public in September, CD4 counts have increased in study participants in a statistically significant manner.

                One trial participant, Matthew Sharp, learned that he was HIV positive over 20 years ago. He battles HIV as
                a patient and an AIDS activist, and his lowered CD4+ counts have made him vulnerable to infections. He is
                hopeful that science might help to change his current drug regimen. “One day, after more research with this
                zinc-finger technology, my dream is to be able to stop my antiretroviral medications,” Sharp said in one account about how he is faring.

                The gene-editing community is watching this trial “very carefully,” as it represents a first clinical test for the
                technology, says Dominic Esposito, who works with gene-editing tools on a daily basis and who has
                launched a gene-editing core facility ( Box 1 ). He runs the protein expression lab at Frederick National
                Laboratory for Cancer Research, which is affiliated with the US National Cancer Institute. He says that scientists need to choose mindfully from among the diversified set of gene editors, matching them to their experiment.

                A wide choice of tools
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The techniques to engineer and tailor targeted nucleases originated in academic labs and continue to develop there as well as in industry. Johns Hopkins University researcher Srinivasan Chandrasegaran figured
                out how to hitch the nuclease domain of a restriction enzyme, Fok1, to zinc-finger proteins, thereby creating
                ZFNs.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                These enzymes generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks that are fixed by the cell's own repair pathways, through either nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination. As discovered by Maria
                Jasin and colleagues, a double-strand break in a particular gene greatly stimulates the efficiency with which
                it can be targeted by homologous recombination. Both repair processes are now harnessed by scientists
                for gene editing, either to ferry in new genes or to knock existing genes out.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Some gene-editing tools have been around nearly two decades; others are younger or even brand new. In
                addition to ZFNs, the gene-editing toolbox includes meganucleases, also called homing endonucleases,
                and transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs), which also induce double-stranded breaks.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Transcription activator–like (TAL) effectors are virulence factors from Xanthomonas bacteria, and they give
                these plant pathogens their bite: the bacteria are bad news for cotton and rice. Building in part on decades
                of experience in ZFN development, scientists have rapidly discovered how to harness the DNA-binding domains of these proteins for gene editing in cultured cells and in several organisms.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                A new tool on the distant horizon is an RNA-based system derived from a bacterial line of defense against
                viral attack. A team from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Vienna and Umeå University in Sweden suggests that a dual-RNA structure directing a site-specific nuclease could be the basis of a
                gene-editing tool that is “efficient, versatile and programmable”. Commenting on this work, Rodolphe Barrangou from DuPont Nutrition and Health points out that a nucleic acid–based member of the gene-editing
                tool family, unlike ZFNs and TALENs, would not require redesign for every DNA target.
