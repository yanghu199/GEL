                During the early 2000s, delegates to the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Biological Diversity negotiated a
                “biosafety protocol” to regulate the international movement of organisms genetically modified with the
                newest, most precise techniques, which they dubbed “living modified organisms,” or LMOs. The protocol is
                based on the bogus “precautionary principle,” which dictates that every new product or technology – including, in this case, an improvement over less-precise technologies – must be proven completely safe before it
                can be used. Rather than creating a uniform, predictable, and scientifically sound framework for effectively
                managing legitimate risks, the U.N.’s biosafety protocol established an amorphous global regulatory process that encourages overly risk-averse, incompetent, or corrupt regulators to hide behind the precautionary principle in delaying or denying approvals. It has become a self-defeating impediment to the development of new and better products. To “celebrate” the 15th anniversary of the Protocol, the UN Environment
                Program is seeking articles about various aspects of it, illustrating yet again the poor judgement and audacity of United Nations' programs and officials.

                The political elites who advocate bigger and more intrusive government habitually try to use scientific literacy as a rhetorical cudgel to beat down the uncomprehending masses. In doing so, all too often they display
                their own ignorance. We were dumbstruck, for example, by this announcement from the United Nations:
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), part of UN Environment, is seeking articles on key issues of
                the Protocol, an international agreement which aims to ensure the safe handling, transport and use of living
                modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on biodiversity.1 <br>
                That’s rather like the Ford Motor Company heralding the anniversary of the 1958 introduction of the ill-fated
                Edsel
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                During the early 2000s, delegates to the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Biological Diversity negotiated a
                “biosafety protocol” to regulate the international movement of organisms genetically modified with the
                newest, most precise techniques, which they dubbed “living modified organisms,” or LMOs.2 The protocol
                is based on the bogus “precautionary principle,” which dictates that every new product or technology – including, in this case, an improvement over less-precise technologies – must be proven completely safe
                before it can be used.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                An ounce of prevention is certainly desirable, but because nothing can be proven completely safe – at
                least, not to the standard demanded by many activists and regulators – the precautionary principle has
                become a self-defeating impediment to the development of new and better products. Of course, many precautionary principle advocates in the anti-technology environmental movement appear to view that as a
                feature, not a bug.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Precautionary regulation shifts the burden of proof from the regulator, who previously had to demonstrate
                that a new technology was likely to cause some harm, to the innovator, who must demonstrate that the
                technology will not cause harm under any circumstances.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                This change is ominous, because it raises the conundrum of how much is enough and frees regulatory
                bodies to require any amount and kind of testing that they wish. Rather than creating a uniform, predictable, and scientifically sound framework for effectively managing legitimate risks, the U.N.’s biosafety protocol established a vague global regulatory process that enables overly risk-averse, incompetent, or corrupt
                regulators to hide behind the precautionary principle in delaying or denying approvals.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                he Cartagena Protocol reflects earlier and presages later wrong-headed applications of the Precautionary
                Principle, including the rejection of badly needed food aid by several African countries (2002–2004) for no
                other reason than it contained the very same superior genetically engineered varieties of grain consumed
                routinely in North America3; a six-year-long moratorium on approvals of genetically engineered plants
                throughout Europe (which began in 1998); and recently (2018), a bizarre, scientifically insupportable decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that organisms modified with the newest gene
                editing techniques fall into the overregulated, arbitrarily defined, non-category of “GMOs.”4
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Cartagena Protocol is by no means the only U.N. project to cause mischief, or worse. In 2003 the
                Codex Alimentarius Commission, the joint food-standards program of the U.N.’s World Health Organization
                and its Food and Agriculture Organization, singled out only food products made with modern molecular genetic engineering techniques for unscientific and Draconian regulatory procedures and restrictions – regula
                tory requirements that cannot be met by conventionally produced foods made with less precise, less predictable technology.5
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Overly burdensome standards for genetically engineered foods are ominous not only because of their
                direct effects on research and development, but also because they will make beneficial new crop plants unavailable to the resource-poor farmers in less-developed countries who need them most.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Scientists worldwide have agreed for decades that molecular genetic engineering is merely a refinement, or
                improvement, over less-precise and predictable genetic techniques that have been used for centuries, an
                exquisite tool that can help in the development of plants with higher yields and innovative traits.6 Thousands of greenhouse and field studies, as well as widespread commercialization in a half-dozen advanced
                countries (and on a limited basis in a couple dozen less-developed countries), have documented that the
                risks of genetically engineered plants and foods are minimal, their benefits palpable, and their future potential extraordinary. Globally, the adoption of genetically engineered crops annually reduces pesticide use by
                tens of millions of pounds and prevents the erosion of millions of tons of topsoil.7
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In less-developed countries throughout Asia and Africa, the few available genetically engineered plant varieties have increased crop yields, raised the income of resource-poor farmers, and reduced occupational
                exposure to chemical pesticides. Wider adoption and diffusion of genetically engineered crops could improve human nutrition, reduce the amount of land and water needed to produce food, and spare ecosystems from fragmentation and development. But these advances are being drastically limited by the malign
                influence of unscientific, hugely burdensome, U.N.-based (as well as national) regulatory regimes.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The U.N.’s precautionary principle-driven standards and regulations actually harm the environment and
                public health, stifling the development of environmentally friendly innovations that can increase agricultural
                productivity, help clean up toxic wastes, conserve water, supplant agricultural chemicals, and reduce the
                contamination of grain by fungal toxins.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Many U.N. experts themselves warn that the greatest single threat to the planet’s environment comes from
                the world’s burgeoning population and its demand that ever more land and freshwater for irrigation be devoted to food production. But the regulatory regimes promoted by various U.N. agencies and programs
                deny less developed countries precisely the kinds of technologies they need.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                How do such travesties of regulation arise? Through a kind of “Emperor’s New Clothes” process in which
                self-interested participants move a flawed proposal through the stepwise approval process, all the while
                pretending that it makes sense. But although the process appears to be legitimate and transparent, it is
                corrupt. The U.N. uses various kinds of coercion to induce countries to sign on to agreements like the Cartagena Protocol and the Codex standards, which regulate genetic engineering excessively and unscientifically.
