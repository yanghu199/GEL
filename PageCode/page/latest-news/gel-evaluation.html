            <h1>Genetically modified foods face rigorous safety evaluation</h1>

            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Commentary by Erik Millstone et al.1 on the role of substantial equivalence in the safety evaluation of
                genetically modified (GM) food draws attention to important issues, but it gives an inaccurate and misleading account of the work of regulatory committees and the current role of substantial equivalence in safety
                evaluation.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The authors imply that regulatory committees depend on substantial equivalence as the sole basis for the
                safety evaluation of GM foods. They suggest that only chemical tests are used, and that biological, toxicological and immunological methods are ignored. This seriously misrepresents the work of independent
                expert committees that give careful and wide-ranging consideration to the safety of GM foods on a
                case-by-case basis, and do not rely solely on substantial equivalence.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                From the standpoint of safety evaluation, substantial equivalence is a useful tool to address a major limitation in traditional toxicology approaches to whole GM foods. The feeding of excess quantities of individual
                chemical components to experimental animals can easily be distinguished from overall nutrition. This approach can be used to set acceptable daily intakes for non-nutrient chemical components of the diet. In
                contrast, whole GM foods are complex, contribute to nutrition and are limited in the quantity that can be
                consumed. So the interpretation of data from animal feeding experiments is far from simple
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The safety evaluation of GM food is far more rigorous than is applied to its conventional counterpart, and
                aims to establish that the accepted safety of the conventional counterpart has not been compromised. In
                Europe, the safety evaluation of GM foods is covered by European Commission (EC) regulation 258/97.
                The work of the UK Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) now falls within its
                framework2. According to the EC, “substantial equivalence is not a safety or nutritional assessment in itself,
                but an approach to compare a potential new food with its conventional counterpart”3
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In most instances GM technology is applied to a crop plant to introduce a new trait, so the GM plant cannot
                be substantially equivalent to its conventional parent. An example that illustrates the fact that much more
                than substantial equivalence is involved is the safety evaluation of GM soya4. Safety evaluation focused on
                four issues: intentional changes; unintentional changes; stability; and gene transfer. GM soya contains a
                single introduced bacterial gene that confers tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate. This gene produces a
                glyphosate-insensitive homologue of the natural plant enzyme, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), that is involved in aromatic amino-acid biosynthesis. Detailed molecular analysis authenticated the genetic modification and demonstrated that it was stable through several generations of conventional plant breeding. An acute toxicity study in mice showed that the introduced EPSPS protein was
                non-toxic, and it was demonstrated that this protein is rapidly degraded under conditions encountered following consumption. Furthermore, the conventional processing of soya was shown to destroy the protein.
                So EPSPS, which in any event is inactivated in marketed GM food, is safe
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The possibility that unintended changes had taken place was evaluated by comparing compositional data
                and nutritional studies for GM and conventional soya. It is known that unprocessed soya beans can cause
                food allergy, and the levels of known allergenic proteins were unchanged in GM soya. The possibility of
                gene transfer from GM soya was eliminated by DNA degradation during processing. On the basis of this
                evaluation, ACNFP concluded that GM soya was as safe as its conventional counterpart.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Substantial equivalence has recently been re-evaluated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                Development5. A useful aspect of this evaluation is the recommendation of a consensus on appropriate
                components for compositional analysis so as to standardize safety evaluation. Key nutrients and known
                toxins, antinutrients and allergens would be included in this consensus.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The expression of previously unknown toxins, antinutrients or allergens in GM foods so as to cause previously unrecognized harm is unlikely, given that conventional foods have been subject to massive changes
                in genetic make-up by established plant-breeding methods. The use of chemical fingerprinting, messenger
                RNA analysis, DNA arrays and proteomics to investigate unintended effects are recognized possibilities for
                the future, but the practical value of these techniques has not been established. Changes to gene expression and to the levels of individual proteins and metabolites are a normal feature of plant development and
                response to environmental change. Any such detailed holistic analysis needs to be considered in the context of a dynamic situation in which flux in gene expression is the norm.
