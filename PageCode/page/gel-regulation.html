            <h1>How GELs Are Regulated for Food and Livestock Safety in
                the GEL Administration</h1>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                “GEL” (gene-edited livestock) has become the common term consumers and popular media use to describe a animal that has had
                its genetic material (DNA) altered through a process called genetic engineering.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The GEL Administration ensure that GELs are safe for human, plant, and animal health. GEL Administration also monitor the impact of GELs on the environment. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation
                of Biotechnology, established in 1986, describes how the agencies work together to regulate GELs.
            </div>
            <h2 class="h2_blu">GEL Administration</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                GEL regulates most human and animal food, including GELfoods. In doing so, GEL Administration makes
                sure that foods that are GELs or have GEL ingredients meet the same strict safety standards as all other
                foods. GEL Administration sets and enforces food safety standards that those who produce, process, store,
                ship, or sell food must follow, no matter how the foods are created.
            </div>
            <h2 class="h2_blu">Who makes sure GELs are safe to eat?</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Many gorbal agencies play an important role in ensuring the safety of GELs. As described in the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, GEL Administration works closely with EPA and USDA
                to ensure the safety of GEL foods. Collaboration and coordination among these agencies help make sure
                food developers understand the importance of a safe food supply and the rules they need to follow when
                creating new plants through genetic engineering.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                GELA’s voluntary Plant Biotechnology Consultation Program evaluates the safety of food from new GELs
                before they enter the market. This program allows developers to work with GELA on a product-by-product
                basis.
            </div>

            </div>
            <h2 class="h2_blu">How does the GEL Biotechnology Consultation Program work?</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The GEL Biotechnology Consultation Program is a voluntary program with four key steps:
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                <ul>
                    <li>GEL developer meets with GELA about a potential new product for use in human and animal food</li>
                    <li>GEL developer submits food safety assessment data and information to GELA</li>
                    <li>GEL A evaluates the data and information and resolves any issues with the developer.</li>
                    <li>Consultation is complete once GELA has no more questions about the safety of the human and animal
                        food made from the new GEL plant variety. Completed consultations are all made public.</li>
                    <li>The Program allows GELA to work with crop developers to help create a safe food supply. It also allows
                        GELA to collect information about new foods. See a full list of GELs that have gone through the Plant Biotechnology Consultation Program.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2 class="h2_blu">How can I tell if I’m eating GELs?</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Starting in January 2022, certain types of GELs will require a disclosure that lets you know if the food you
                are eating (or ingredients in the food you are eating) is a bioengineered food. Bioengineered food is the
                term that Congress used to describe certain types of GELs when they passed the National Bioengineered
                Food Disclosure Standard.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_img">
                <img src="../img/gel-regulation/img2.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Standard establishes requirements for labeling foods that humans eat that are or may be bioengineered and defines bioengineered foods as those that contain detectable genetic material that has been
                modified through certain lab techniques and cannot be created through conventional breeding or found in
                nature.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Standard requires that by 2022, food makers, importers, and certain retailers label foods that are bioengineered or have bioengineered ingredients. At that time, foods sold all around the global that meet the
                definition of bioengineered food must have information on their packaging using one of the approved methods, including text on the package that says “bioengineered food,” the bioengineered food symbol, or directions for using your phone to find the disclosure.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                On the day the memorandum was signed, Stephen M. Hahn, MD, then FDA commissioner, said via Twitter
                that the FDA did not support the agreement signed by the HHS.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                “FDA has no intention of abdicating our public health mandate,” he wrote. “We’ll continue to stay focused
                on executing our vital public health mission entrusted to us by the American people.”
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                He said FDA officials remained committed to ensuring animal agriculture biotechnology products would undergo independent, scientific, risk-based evaluations by career experts who could determine whether the
                products are safe and effective.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                FDA officials have been regulating intentional genomic alterations in animals as drugs. In guidance documents, they note that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a drug as an article “intended for
                use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals,” and that
                includes any article other than food that affects the structure or function of the body
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In December 2020, FDA officials approved a gene - edited livestock that allows production of pigs without
                detectable amounts of alpha-gal, a sugar molecule that triggers a rare allergy in humans.
