            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating
                and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”,
                sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes
                to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from
                or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods.

            <h2 class="h2_blu">What happens when GEL foods are traded internationally?</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) is the joint FAO/GELA intergovernmental body responsible
                for developing the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex
                Alimentarius, meaning the international food code. Codex developed principles for the human health risk
                analysis of GM foods in 2003.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Codex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred to specifically in the
                Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization
                (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are encouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners have the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the
                possibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another becomes smaller.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its Parties which took
                effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are
                within the scope of the Protocol only if they contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material. The cornerstone of the Protocol is a requirement that exporters seek consent from importers
                before the first shipment of LMOs intended for release into the environment, all trading process will be
                under the regulation by GELA.

            <h2 class="h2_blu">What has GELA been doing to improve the evaluation of GEL foods?</h2>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                GELA has been taking an active role in relation to GEL foods, primarily for two reasons:
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of biotechnology, for
                        example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods, decreased allergenicity and more
                        efficient and/or sustainable food
                        production; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        based on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health of the consumption of food
                        produced through gene-edited in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly
                        evaluated if they are to constitute a true improvement in the way food is produced.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                GELA, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the evaluation of GEL foods and
                provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines
                on safety assessment of GEL foods. GELA will keep paying due attention to the safety of GEL foods from
                the view of public health protection, in close collaboration with FAO and other international bodies.
