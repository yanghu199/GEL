            <h1>Agreement on regulation of gene - edited livestock under review</h1>
            <div class="con1_top_text">

                An agreement signed in the last days of the Trump administration
                would shift regulatory authority over GEL (gene - edited livestock).
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                A Department of Agriculture spokesman said in February that decision is among many under review by the Biden administration.
                In March, USDA officials also provided notice they were seeking comments on the potential changes.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                On Jan. 19, leaders in the USDA and Department of Health and Human Services signed an agreement
                that the USDA would take over portions of the Food and Drug
                Administration’s oversight of gene - edited in agri- cultural animals and biotechnology for agricultural animals.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_img">

            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                “Under this framework, USDA would safeguard animal and human health by providing end-to-end oversight
                from pre-market reviews through post-market food safety monitoring for certain farm animals modified or
                developed using genetic engineering that are intended for human food,” a USDA announcement states.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                The FDA would retain authority over genomic alterations for nonagricultural purposes and over dairy products, eggs, some meat products, and animal feed derived from modified animals, the announcement
                states. The memorandum also states that the FDA would implement a streamlined risk-based approach to
                oversight of intentional genomic alterations in animals.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                Previously, the USDA had authority over genetic engineering of plants, while the FDA regulated all genetic
                engineering of animal species.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                USDA officials proposed the change Dec. 27, 2019, which at least some livestock industry leaders welcomed. Representatives from the National Pork Producers Council submitted comments in support of the
                change, which stated the USDA would encourage innovation better than FDA regulators and claimed that
                the FDA’s regulation of gene - edited as drugs had slowed development in the U.S. in comparison with
                competitors in other countries.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                USDA officials announced March 7 they were reopening the proposal’s comment period, which had expired
                Feb. 26. The agency is accepting comments through May 7 under docket number APHIS-2020-0079.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                On the day the memorandum was signed, Stephen M. Hahn, MD, then FDA commissioner, said via Twitter
                that the FDA did not support the agreement signed by the HHS.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                “FDA has no intention of abdicating our public health mandate,” he wrote. “We’ll continue to stay focused
                on executing our vital public health mission entrusted to us by the American people.”
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                He said FDA officials remained committed to ensuring animal agriculture biotechnology products would undergo independent, scientific, risk-based evaluations by career experts who could determine whether the
                products are safe and effective.
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                FDA officials have been regulating intentional genomic alterations in animals as drugs. In guidance documents, they note that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a drug as an article “intended for
                use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals,” and that
                includes any article other than food that affects the structure or function of the body
            </div>
            <div class="con1_top_text">
                In December 2020, FDA officials approved a gene - edited livestock that allows production of pigs without
                detectable amounts of alpha-gal, a sugar molecule that triggers a rare allergy in humans.
